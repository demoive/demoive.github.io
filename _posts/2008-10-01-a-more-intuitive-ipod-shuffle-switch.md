The iPod Shuffle is a wonderful little product and in my opinion is by far the best mp3 player that doesn’t display information about what is playing. But there is an element of its design that I consider to be flawed and which I attribute to Apple’s consistent choice to sacrifice options for the sake of simplicity.

One of the two switches on the iPod Shuffle chooses the play mode: either _Continuous Playback_ or _Shuffle_. The former will repeatedly loop through all the songs in the order that they were added to the iPod from iTunes. The _Shuffle_ mode will obviously play through them randomly, but will it stop playing after all the songs have been played through once? Are _Shuffle_ and _Continuous Playback_ mutually exclusive?

This conflict seems minor, but there might be a major design flaw here. A switch is a user interface element that chooses between two possibilities. Ideally, neither choice implies the other (or else a different user interface element would be used…more about this later). But in the case of the iPod Shuffle, the _Shuffle_ mode implies continuous playback as well. And I agree that it should—it’s intuitive to me that _Shuffle_ would also continuously loop through all the songs. But with the current setup (<img src="/assets/img/shuffle-icon_0.gif" alt="Default Shuffle Symbol" style="margin-bottom: -1px;">), however, moving the switch from _Continuous Playback_ to _Shuffle_ is contradictory. I would have at least made the symbol something like: <img src="/assets/img/shuffle-icon_1.gif" alt="Alternate Shuffle Symbol Suggestion 1" style="margin-bottom: -1px;"> or <img src="/assets/img/shuffle-icon_2.gif" alt="Alternate Shuffle Symbol Suggestion 2" style="margin-bottom: -1px;">.

You might now be saying to yourself: “That’s all fine and dandy because the current symbols on either side of the switch are simply graphical representations of two preset modes: one that continuously loops through the songs **in order** and another that continuously loops through the songs but **in a random order**.” Well, let’s not be so quick to make that assumption because as much as I’d agree with you, that’s not the way iTunes does it. iTunes uses buttons to select the mode allowing the user to turn both _Shuffle_ **and** _Continuous Playback_ on at the same time.

And let’s not kid ourselves that it is ok to have iTunes do something different than all the iPods out there. Apple’s success with their line of mp3 players (as well as their other products) is almost entirely attributable the almost necessary connection between their hardware and software components.
